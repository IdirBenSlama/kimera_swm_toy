# Kimera SWM Research Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive research grounding materials for the Kimera Spherical Word Methodology project.

## Overview

The research grounding roadmap transforms Kimera SWM from an innovative prototype into a scientifically rigorous cognitive architecture through three pillars:

1. **Theoretical Foundations** - Mathematical formalization of semantic manifolds, geoid theory, and thermodynamic knowledge dynamics
2. **Mathematical Rigor** - Formal proofs, computational complexity analysis, and algorithmic bounds
3. **Experimental Validation** - Comprehensive benchmarks, human studies, and real-world applications
