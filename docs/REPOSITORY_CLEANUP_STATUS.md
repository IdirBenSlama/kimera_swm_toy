# Repository Cleanup Status

## Current Progress

### ✅ Completed
- **Directory Structure**: Created organized folder hierarchy
- **Test Organization**: Tests moved to `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/functional/`
- **Documentation**: Core docs in `docs/`, historical files in `docs/ARCHIVE/`
- **Scripts**: Utility scripts organized in `scripts/`
- **CI Configuration**: Simplified to single `ci.yml` file

### 🔄 In Progress
- **Root Directory Cleanup**: Still contains ~100+ files that need organization
- **Markdown Files**: 50+ status/summary files need to move to `docs/ARCHIVE/`
- **Python Scripts**: 30+ utility scripts need to move to `scripts/`
- **Test Files**: 20+ test files need to move to appropriate `tests/` subdirectories

```

### 3. Test Functionality
```bash
# Ensure everything still works
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```
