# CLS Lattice Integration Guide

## Overview

The CLS (Conceptual Lattice System) integration provides advanced lattice resolution and form creation capabilities within Kimera's unified identity system.

## Key Concepts

### Lattice Resolution
Lattice resolution computes the conceptual intensity between two identities, taking into account their entropy, relationships, and temporal decay.

### Lattice Forms
Lattice forms are structured representations that combine multiple identities into coherent conceptual structures.

## Basic Usage

### Simple Lattice Resolution
```python
from kimera.cls import lattice_resolve
from kimera.storage import LatticeStorage

# Initialize storage
storage = LatticeStorage("kimera.db")

# Resolve intensity between two identities
intensity = lattice_resolve("geoid_abc123", "geoid_def456")
print(f"Lattice intensity: {intensity:.3f}")
```

### Creating Lattice Forms
```python
from kimera.cls import create_lattice_form

# Create a lattice form combining multiple identities
form = create_lattice_form(
    name="AI Ethics Discussion",
    geo_a="geoid_ai_benefits",
    geo_b="geoid_ai_risks",
    metadata={
        "context": "philosophical debate",
        "domain": "artificial intelligence",
        "created_by": "research_team"
    }
)
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Tau Configuration
```python
# Override default time decay parameters
storage = LatticeStorage("kimera.db", default_tau_days=7.0)

# This affects how quickly identities decay over time
intensity = lattice_resolve("id1", "id2")  # Uses custom tau
```

### Repeated Resolution Caching
```python
# Lattice resolution includes intelligent caching
intensity1 = lattice_resolve("id1", "id2")  # Computed fresh
intensity2 = lattice_resolve("id1", "id2")  # May use cached result

# Cache is automatically invalidated when identities change
```

### Batch Resolution
```python
# Resolve multiple identity pairs efficiently
identity_pairs = [
    ("geoid_a", "geoid_b"),
    ("geoid_b", "geoid_c"),
    ("geoid_a", "geoid_c")
]

intensities = []
for id_a, id_b in identity_pairs:
    intensity = lattice_resolve(id_a, id_b)
    intensities.append(intensity)
    
print(f"Average intensity: {sum(intensities) / len(intensities):.3f}")
```

## Integration with Identity System

### Working with Geoids
```python
from kimera.identity import create_geoid_identity

# Create content identities
geoid1 = create_geoid_identity("Machine learning transforms healthcare")
geoid2 = create_geoid_identity("AI diagnosis accuracy concerns")

# Store in lattice
storage.store_identity(geoid1)
storage.store_identity(geoid2)

# Resolve their conceptual relationship
intensity = lattice_resolve(geoid1.id, geoid2.id)
```

### Working with Scars
```python
from kimera.identity import create_scar_identity

# Create relationship identity
scar = create_scar_identity(geoid1.id, geoid2.id, weight=0.8)
scar.meta = {"relationship_type": "tension"}

# Store the relationship
storage.store_identity(scar)

# Lattice resolution considers these relationships
intensity = lattice_resolve(geoid1.id, geoid2.id)  # Influenced by scar
```

## Lattice Form Structure

### Form Components
```python
# A lattice form contains:
form = {
    "name": "Discussion Topic",
    "primary_identities": ["geoid_1", "geoid_2"],
    "supporting_identities": ["scar_1", "scar_2"],
    "lattice_intensity": 0.75,
    "metadata": {
        "domain": "philosophy",
        "complexity": "high",
        "participants": ["alice", "bob"]
    },
    "created_at": "2024-12-19T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Form Serialization
```python
import json

# Serialize form for storage
form_json = json.dumps(form, indent=2)

# Save to file or database
with open("lattice_form.json", "w") as f:
    f.write(form_json)
```

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Resolution Patterns
```python
# Pre-load frequently accessed identities
frequently_used = ["geoid_1", "geoid_2", "geoid_3"]
for identity_id in frequently_used:
    identity = storage.fetch_identity(identity_id)
    # Identity is now cached for faster access

# Batch operations when possible
all_intensities = {}
for id_a in frequently_used:
    for id_b in frequently_used:
        if id_a != id_b:
            key = f"{id_a}:{id_b}"
            all_intensities[key] = lattice_resolve(id_a, id_b)
```

### Memory Management
```python
# For large-scale lattice operations
def process_lattice_batch(identity_ids, batch_size=100):
    """Process lattice resolutions in batches to manage memory."""
    for i in range(0, len(identity_ids), batch_size):
        batch = identity_ids[i:i + batch_size]
        
        # Process batch
        for id_a in batch:
            for id_b in batch:
                if id_a != id_b:
                    intensity = lattice_resolve(id_a, id_b)
                    yield (id_a, id_b, intensity)
```

## Integration with EchoForm

### EchoForm Compatibility
```python
from kimera.echoform import EchoForm

# Create EchoForm with lattice-resolved identities
echo = EchoForm(
    anchor="lattice_resolved_concept",
    domain="philosophical_discussion", 
    phase="active"
)

# Add terms based on lattice resolution
for identity_id in related_identities:
    intensity = lattice_resolve(anchor_id, identity_id)
    if intensity > 0.5:  # Threshold for inclusion
        echo.add_term(identity_id, weight=intensity)
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Resolution Diagnostics
```python
def diagnose_resolution(id_a, id_b):
    """Diagnose lattice resolution computation."""
    
    # Fetch identities
    identity_a = storage.fetch_identity(id_a)
    identity_b = storage.fetch_identity(id_b)
    
    if not identity_a or not identity_b:
        print("One or both identities not found")
        return
    
    print(f"Identity A: {identity_a.identity_type}, entropy: {identity_a.entropy():.3f}")
    print(f"Identity B: {identity_b.identity_type}, entropy: {identity_b.entropy():.3f}")
    
    # Compute resolution
    intensity = lattice_resolve(id_a, id_b)
    print(f"Lattice intensity: {intensity:.3f}")
    
    return intensity
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
import time

def timed_resolution(id_a, id_b):
    """Time lattice resolution for performance monitoring."""
    start_time = time.time()
    intensity = lattice_resolve(id_a, id_b)
    end_time = time.time()
    
    duration = end_time - start_time
    print(f"Resolution took {duration:.3f} seconds")
    
    return intensity, duration
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use meaningful identity names** for easier debugging and monitoring
2. **Set appropriate tau values** based on your domain's temporal requirements
3. **Monitor resolution performance** for large-scale applications
4. **Cache frequently accessed results** to improve performance
5. **Use batch operations** when processing multiple resolutions
6. **Include metadata** in lattice forms for better traceability
7. **Test resolution behavior** with known identity relationships

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Low Resolution Intensities**:
- Check if identities exist in storage
- Verify identity entropy values
- Consider adjusting tau parameters

**Performance Issues**:
- Use batch processing for multiple resolutions
- Implement caching for frequently accessed identities
- Monitor database query performance

**Unexpected Results**:
- Use diagnostic functions to trace resolution computation
- Verify identity relationships and metadata
- Check for data corruption in storage
