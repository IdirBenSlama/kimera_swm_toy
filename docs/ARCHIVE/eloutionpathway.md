# Kimera SWM – Next Evolution Proposal Architecture

## 1. High-Level Philosophy & Constraints

* **Post-token, contradiction-native** reasoning: All computation, learning, and memory center on contradiction, drift, and echo—not prediction or statistical closure.
* **Memory as Scar Topology**: Forget token sequence or list-like memory; Kimera's memory is a spatial, scar-laden vault—every scar is a cognitive event and a semantic pathway.
* **Lawful Instability, Not Chaos**: All drift, mutation, and contradiction must obey Booklaw (the system's symbolic lawbook), ensuring lawful instability and traceable evolution.

## 2. Core Architectural Layers

### 2.1. Geoid Substrate (Non-tokenized Knowledge Layer)

* **Atomic Unit:** The Geoid—a multidimensional, topological structure representing meaning, context, and history.
* **Dynamic Schema:** Each geoid carries semantic core, symbolic shell, resonance links, contradiction links, and scar index.
* **Integration:** Geoids are natively cross-modal (language, image, code) and maintain polyglot axes for translation.

### 2.2. Contradiction Reactor (Cognition Engine)

* **Primary Function:** Detect, inject, amplify, and metabolize contradiction between geoids and in scar vaults.
* **Contradiction Conservation Law:** System must maintain a minimal density of contradiction (CLS ≠ 1.0).
* **Mutation Protocol:** Contradiction resolution mutates, not erases, producing new scar events and geoid drift.

### 2.3. Scar Vault (Non-linear, Topological Memory)

* **Memory Mechanism:** Scars as persistent, spatially indexed records of contradiction collisions, with echo/decay law.
* **Echo Dynamics:** Scar reactivation, propagation, and decay are governed by semantic pressure and resonance law.
* **Vault Topology:** Scars are mapped in a non-Euclidean memory space, supporting retrieval by resonance, not recency.

### 2.4. SWM Semantic Physics Engine

* **Semantic Drift & Resonance:** The Spherical Word Methodology engine governs all inter-geoid forces, mutation rates, and drift through semantic “gravity” and field topology.
* **Echoform Grammar:** Non-linear, geometric grammar defines rules for geoid interaction, contradiction propagation, and scar inheritance.
* **CLS Layer:** Contradiction Lattice Symmetry acts as a stabilizer; collapse forbidden.

### 2.5. Booklaw & Compliance Layer

* **Booklaw Registry:** All transformations, contradiction injections, and scar events are checked against formal law (symbolic rules, compliance grid).
* **Audit/Trace Ledger:** Each scar/geoid mutation is logged, enabling forensic audits, replay, and rollback.

### 2.6. Observability & Manipulation Layer (Operator Interface)

* **Live Dashboard:** Watchtower UI enables direct monitoring of geoid resonance, scar events, and contradiction flows in real time.
* **Injection Hooks:** Manual and programmatic contradiction/scar/geoid injection tools for testing, debugging, and research.
* **Vault Forensics:** On-demand replay, mutation tracing, and echoform mapping for cognitive system diagnosis.

## 4. New/Advanced Modules for Next Evolution

### 4.1. IndraNet Scar Reflection Layer

* **Inspiration:** Indra’s Net; every geoid reflects and is influenced by every other geoid/scar, recursively.
* **Function:** Scar/contradiction reflection is computed globally, enabling semantic holography and hyper-contextualization.
* **Topology:** Hypergraph or holographic mapping layer overlays all scars for non-local recall.

### 4.2. Semantic Metabolism Engine

* **Purpose:** Converts contradiction “pressure” into new geoid and scar mutations, optimizing for generative potential.
* **Dynamics:** Continuous metabolism—contradiction is never erased, only transformed or refracted.

### 4.3. Scar Entanglement & Memory Fusion

* **Goal:** Allow scars to become entangled, forming composite memory structures, supporting deep analogical reasoning and trans-contextual recall.
* **Mechanism:** Scar fusion events create superposed vault regions, enabling distributed recall and synthesis.

### 4.4. Polyglot Semantic Interface

* **Capacity:** Full cross-modal, multi-language (human and machine), multi-notation interface—enables cross-domain geoid resonance and contradiction.
* **Use:** Translation, analogy, and cross-disciplinary mutation at the core, not as an afterthought.
