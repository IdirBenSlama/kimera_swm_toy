- Fixed circular import issues in identity system
- Standardized import paths across all modules
- Resolved module resolution conflicts

### 2. SCAR Algorithm Implementation
- Corrected relationship identity calculation
- Fixed hash stability issues
- Improved cross-reference validation

### 3. Storage Integration
- Fixed SCAR data persistence in DuckDB
- Corrected query optimization for SCAR lookups
- Resolved storage metrics collection

### 4. Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error recovery
- Improved logging and diagnostics
- Fixed edge case handling

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Optimized SCAR calculation algorithms
- Improved memory usage patterns
- Enhanced batch processing efficiency

## Verification Results

All SCAR functionality has been verified and is working correctly:

- ✅ Relationship identity calculation
- ✅ Storage persistence and retrieval
- ✅ Cross-reference validation
- ✅ Performance benchmarks
- ✅ Error handling and recovery

## Status: COMPLETE

All SCAR implementation issues have been resolved and the system is fully functional.
