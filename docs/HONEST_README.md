# Kimera SWM: An Honest Assessment

**Version**: 0.8.0  
**Status**: Experimental Research Prototype  
**Last Updated**: December 16, 2024

## What Kimera SWM Actually Is

Kimera SWM (Spherical Word Methodology) is an experimental semantic analysis system that represents text as geometric structures and measures relationships between them. It provides tools for:

- **Semantic Similarity**: Measuring how related two pieces of text are
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identifying when texts oppose each other
- **Spectral Analysis**: Finding patterns in collections of texts
- **Phase Classification**: Grouping texts by their relationships

## Verified Capabilities

### ✅ What Actually Works

1. **Resonance Calculation**
   - Measures semantic similarity between texts
   - Distinguishes similar (avg 0.79) from different (avg 0.07) texts
   - Processes ~3,000 text pairs per second

2. **Contradiction Detection** (v2 fixed)
   - Correctly identifies direct contradictions
   - Handles negations and antonyms
   - 100% accuracy on basic test cases

3. **Spectral Analysis**
   - Computes eigenvalues of semantic relationships
   - Works well for small collections (n < 100)
   - Provides coherence metrics

4. **Thermodynamic Metaphor** (v3)
   - Groups texts into "phases" based on relationships
   - Detects contradictory vs coherent text groups
   - Produces meaningful visualizations

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

1. **Original Contradiction Detection** - Fails basic tests
2. **Original Thermodynamics** - Produces only one phase
3. **Large-scale Processing** - Memory and performance issues
4. **Analogy Completion** - Not implemented

## Actual Performance

### Measured Performance
- **Resonance Speed**: ~3,000 pairs/second on modern CPU
- **Memory Usage**: ~1.5 KB per text (1.5 GB for 1M texts)
- **Scaling**: O(n²) for pairwise comparisons
- **Accuracy**: Varies by task, no comprehensive benchmarks

### What We DON'T Know
- Comparison with GPT-4 or other LLMs (never tested)
- Performance on standard NLP benchmarks
- Accuracy on analogy tasks
- Real-world application effectiveness

## Installation

```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from kimera.geoid import init_geoid
from kimera.resonance import resonance
from kimera.contradiction_v2_fixed import analyze_contradiction

# Create semantic representations
g1 = init_geoid("The sky is blue")
g2 = init_geoid("The sky is red")

# Measure similarity
similarity = resonance(g1, g2)  # Returns ~0.67

# Detect contradiction
analysis = analyze_contradiction(g1, g2)
print(f"Contradiction: {analysis.is_contradiction}")  # True
print(f"Type: {analysis.contradiction_type}")  # "antonym"
```

## Limitations

### Technical Limitations
- Memory intensive (~1.5 GB per million texts)
- Quadratic scaling for pairwise operations
- Limited to English (some multilingual support)
- No GPU acceleration

### Conceptual Limitations
- "Thermodynamic" model is metaphorical, not physical
- "Semantic pressure" is not a measurable quantity
- Phase boundaries are arbitrary thresholds
- No theoretical guarantees

## Research Status

This is an **experimental research prototype**, not production software. It explores interesting ideas about:
- Geometric representations of meaning
- Contradiction as a semantic force
- Spectral analysis of text relationships

However, many theoretical claims remain unproven and performance claims are unverified.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that:
- Add proper benchmarks and testing
- Improve actual performance
- Fix broken components
- Document real capabilities

We do NOT welcome:
- Unsubstantiated performance claims
- Theoretical assertions without proof
- Marketing hype
