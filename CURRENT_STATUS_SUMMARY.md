# Kimera SWM Current Status Summary

## Date: January 26, 2025

### Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 117
- **Passed**: 91 (77.8%)
- **Failed**: 17 (14.5%)
- **Errors**: 9 (7.7%)

### Key Achievements
1. ✅ Fixed CLS integration tests - all 3 passing
2. ✅ Core functionality working (91 tests passing)
3. ✅ Basic resonance detection implemented
4. ✅ Pattern extraction system in place
5. ✅ Storage system functional (with some Windows-specific issues)

### Main Issues to Address

#### P0 - Critical (Blocking CI)
1. **Windows File Permission Errors** (9 errors)
   - Database files not properly closed before deletion in tests
   - Affects: `test_scar_functionality.py`, `test_storage.py`
   - Solution: Implement proper cleanup with connection closing

2. **Unicode Encoding Errors** 
   - Benchmark script failing on Windows due to emoji characters
   - File: `benchmarks/llm_compare.py`
   - Solution: Fix encoding or remove emojis for Windows

#### P1 - High Priority
1. **API Mismatches** (7 failures)
   - Tests expecting old methods like `fetch_echo_form`, `generate_scar`
   - Solution: Update tests to match current API

2. **EchoForm Initialization** (6 failures)
   - Terms not being properly initialized when passed to constructor
   - Solution: Fix EchoForm constructor to handle terms parameter

#### P2 - Medium Priority
1. **Entropy Calculation** (1 failure)
   - Identity entropy returning 0
   - Solution: Implement proper entropy calculation

### Next Steps (Following Roadmap)

#### Immediate (P0 from 90-day roadmap)
1. Fix Windows file handling in tests
2. Fix Unicode encoding in benchmarks
3. Get CI to green status
4. Tag v0.7.6-rc1

#### Short-term (Phase 2.1-2.2 from main roadmap)
1. Implement proper Pattern Abstraction Engine
2. Enhance multi-dimensional Geoid support
3. Add the "1+3+1" linguistic analysis rule
4. Implement pattern storage and retrieval

#### Medium-term (Phase 2.3)
1. Implement Resonance Detection System
2. Add cross-domain pattern matching
3. Develop resonance scoring system
4. Create validation suite

### Current Implementation vs SWM Theory

#### What's Implemented ✅
- Basic Geoid structure
- Simple resonance detection (semantic similarity)
- Pattern extraction (4 types: functional, structural, dynamic, relational)
- Storage system with DuckDB
- Identity and Scar concepts
- Basic API

#### What's Missing ❌
- Multi-linguistic analysis ("1+3+1" rule)
- Full Geoid dimensions (only basic implementation)
- Dynamic knowledge evolution (scars, drift, voids)
- Symbolic/Chaos layer
- Zetetic inquiry system
- Cross-domain resonance detection
- Insight generation and re-contextualization

### Recommendation

Focus on P0 issues first to stabilize the codebase and get CI green. Then proceed with implementing core SWM features according to the roadmap, starting with enhanced pattern abstraction and multi-dimensional Geoid support.

The project has a solid foundation but needs to evolve from a simple similarity detector to a full SWM implementation that can discover deep cross-domain patterns and generate novel insights.
