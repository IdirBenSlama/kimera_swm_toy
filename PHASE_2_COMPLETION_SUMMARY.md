# Phase 2 Completion Summary: Core SWM Implementation

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 of the Kimera SWM project has successfully implemented the core components of the Spherical Word Methodology, transforming Kimera from a basic similarity detector into a sophisticated system capable of discovering deep cross-domain patterns and generating novel insights.

## Key Achievements ✅

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Geoid Implementation
- **GeoidV2** model with support for 15 dimension types
- Dimensional interaction matrix for measuring coherence
- Evolution tracking and wavelet decomposition capabilities
- Dynamic vector representations for each dimension

### 2. "1+3+1" Linguistic Rule Implementation
- **MultiLanguageAnalyzer** implementing Idir Ben Slama's heuristic
- Automatic selection of maximally unrelated languages
- Symbolic/chaos layer extraction with archetypes and paradoxes
- Cross-linguistic pattern detection and synthesis

### 3. Pattern Abstraction Engine
- Extraction of 4 core pattern types as per SWM:
  - **Functional**: Purpose, actions, inputs/outputs
  - **Structural**: Components, organization, boundaries
  - **Dynamic**: States, transitions, evolution
  - **Relational**: Dependencies, influences, connections
- Pattern comparison and vector representations
- Confidence scoring for extracted patterns

### 4. Enhanced Resonance Detection
- Multiple resonance types beyond semantic similarity
- Cross-domain detection with domain classification
- Insight potential scoring algorithm
- Automatic insight generation from resonance patterns
