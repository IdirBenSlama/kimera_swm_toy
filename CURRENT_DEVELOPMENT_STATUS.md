# Kimera SWM - Current Development Status

## 📍 Current Phase: P1 Complete → P2 Ready

### ✅ Recently Completed: P1 - Full Unified Identity Write-Path

**Completed**: December 2024

**Achievements**:
- ✅ Implemented dual-write storage layer with `KIMERA_ID_DUAL_WRITE` flag
- ✅ Enhanced CLS integration with automatic Geoid → Identity conversion
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite for dual-write functionality
- ✅ Migration scripts ready and tested
- ✅ All tests passing with dual-write enabled

**Key Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/kimera/storage_dual_write.py` - Dual-write storage implementation
- `test_dual_write.py` - Comprehensive dual-write tests
- `test_p0_dual_write.py` - P0 integration tests with dual-write
- `P1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Implementation planning document
- `P1_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Completion summary

## 🚀 Next Priority: P2 - Entropy Instrumentation

### Overview
Add comprehensive entropy tracking and observability to the system.

### Key Tasks:
1. **Prometheus Metrics Integration**
   - Histogram of entropy buckets
   - Identity operation latencies
   - Storage operation metrics

2. **Entropy Tracking**
   - Log entropy events for all identity operations
   - Track entropy distribution over time
   - Monitor effective tau calculations

3. **Grafana Dashboard**
   - Real-time entropy visualization
   - Identity operation metrics
   - System health indicators

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify exponential decay with entropy
   - Test observability hooks
   - Performance impact assessment

## 📊 90-Day Roadmap Status

| Priority | Feature | Status | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| **P0** | CI & Test Stabilization | ✅ Complete | All tests green |
| **P1** | Full Unified Identity | ✅ Complete | Dual-write implemented |
| **P2** | Entropy Instrumentation | 🔄 Next | Ready to start |
| **P3** | Migration & Rollback | 📋 Planned | Partially complete |
| **P4** | Search & Query API | 📋 Planned | Design phase |

## 🏗️ System Architecture Status

### Core Components
- ✅ **Identity System**: Unified model with backward compatibility
- ✅ **Storage Layer**: DuckDB with dual-write support
- ✅ **CLS Integration**: Full Identity support
- ✅ **Entropy Calculation**: Adaptive tau implementation
- ⚠️ **Observability**: Basic hooks in place, needs expansion (P2)
- 📋 **Search API**: Not yet implemented (P4)

### Production Readiness
- **Core Functionality**: ✅ Ready
- **Data Migration**: ✅ Tools ready, needs staging validation
- **Monitoring**: ⚠️ Basic, needs P2 implementation
- **Performance**: ✅ Acceptable (164% dual-write overhead)

## 🔧 Development Environment

### Current Configuration
```bash
# Enable dual-write for testing
export KIMERA_ID_DUAL_WRITE=1

# Run tests
pytest tests/test_cls_integration.py -v
python test_dual_write.py
python test_p0_dual_write.py
```

### Key Commands
```bash
# Check system status
python run_status_check.py

# Run migration
python scripts/migrate_identity.py

# Verify dual-write consistency
python -c "from kimera.storage import get_storage; s = get_storage(); print(s.get_dual_write_stats())"
```

## 📈 Metrics & Performance

### Current Performance
- **Single-write latency**: ~2.19ms per operation
- **Dual-write latency**: ~5.80ms per operation
- **Storage overhead**: ~2x during migration (temporary)
- **Test coverage**: >80% for critical paths

### Target Metrics (P2)
- Entropy calculation latency: <10ms
- Prometheus scrape interval: 15s
- Dashboard refresh rate: 5s
- Alert response time: <1 minute

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Staging Deployment (This Week)**
   - Deploy P1 changes to staging
   - Enable dual-write flag
   - Begin 48-hour monitoring period

2. **P2 Planning (Next Week)**
   - Review observability requirements
   - Design Prometheus metric schema
   - Create Grafana dashboard mockups

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update API documentation
   - Create operator runbook
   - Document monitoring procedures

## 📝 Recent Decisions

1. **Dual-Write Performance**: Accepted 164% overhead as temporary during migration
2. **Storage Schema**: Using DuckDB sequences instead of AUTOINCREMENT
3. **Migration Strategy**: Incremental with verification at each step
4. **Rollback Plan**: Keep legacy tables until full validation complete

## 🚨 Known Issues

1. **Performance**: Dual-write overhead higher than target (164% vs 20%)
   - *Impact*: Acceptable for migration phase
   - *Resolution*: Will be resolved when dual-write disabled

2. **Windows File Locking**: Occasional test cleanup issues
   - *Impact*: Test reliability on Windows
   - *Resolution*: Added retry logic in test cleanup
