# P1 Implementation Plan: Full Unified Identity Write-Path

## Overview
P1 focuses on completing the unified identity system integration with CLS lattice and implementing dual-write functionality for safe migration.

## Current Status
- ✅ Unified Identity model implemented (`src/kimera/identity.py`)
- ✅ Storage layer supports Identity operations (`src/kimera/storage.py`)
- ✅ CLS integration partially complete (`src/kimera/cls.py`)
- ⚠️ Missing: `geoid_to_identity` patch for full backward compatibility
- ⚠️ Missing: Dual-write flag implementation
- ⚠️ Missing: Complete test coverage for dual-write mode

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Implement geoid_to_identity Patch (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Ensure all legacy Geoid usage automatically converts to Identity

#### Tasks:
- [x] Basic `geoid_to_identity` function exists in `identity.py`
- [ ] Add automatic conversion in CLS lattice operations
- [ ] Patch all storage methods to handle Geoid → Identity conversion
- [ ] Add conversion logging for migration tracking

#### Files to Modify:
- `src/kimera/cls.py` - Already has conversion logic, needs testing
- `src/kimera/storage.py` - Add conversion in legacy methods
- `src/kimera/identity.py` - Enhance conversion function

### 2. Implement Dual-Write Flag (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Enable safe migration with parallel writes to both systems

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add `KIMERA_ID_DUAL_WRITE` environment variable support
- [ ] Implement dual-write logic in storage layer
- [ ] Add metrics/logging for dual-write operations
- [ ] Create verification tools to compare dual-write results

#### Implementation Details:
```python
# In storage.py
import os

class LatticeStorage:
    def __init__(self, db_path: str = "kimera_lattice.db"):
        # ... existing code ...
        self.dual_write_enabled = os.getenv('KIMERA_ID_DUAL_WRITE', '0') == '1'
    
    def store_identity(self, identity: Identity):
        # Store in new identity table
        super().store_identity(identity)
        
        # If dual-write enabled, also store as legacy format
        if self.dual_write_enabled:
            self._store_legacy_format(identity)
```

### 3. Update CLS Integration Tests (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Ensure all CLS operations work with Identity model

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Update `test_p0_integration.py` to test with dual-write
- [ ] Add specific dual-write verification tests
- [ ] Test entropy-based optimizations
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility

### 4. Migration Script Enhancement (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Make migration script idempotent and production-ready

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Update `scripts/migrate_identity.py` for idempotency
- [ ] Add dry-run mode
- [ ] Add rollback capability
- [ ] Add progress reporting for large datasets

### 5. Observability Integration (LOW PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Add metrics and logging for identity operations

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics for identity operations
- [ ] Add structured logging for dual-write operations
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboard for migration monitoring
- [ ] Add alerts for dual-write discrepancies

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test Geoid → Identity conversion
- Test dual-write flag behavior
- Test storage operations with both modes
- Test CLS integration with Identity

### Integration Tests
- Full workflow with dual-write enabled
- Migration script testing
- Performance comparison (single vs dual-write)
- Data consistency verification

### Staging Deployment
1. Enable dual-write flag on staging
2. Run migration script
3. Monitor for 24-48 hours
4. Verify data consistency
5. Performance analysis

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ All tests pass with `KIMERA_ID_DUAL_WRITE=1`
- ✅ Zero data loss during migration
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ CLS operations work seamlessly

### Performance Targets
- Dual-write overhead: < 20% latency increase
- Storage overhead: < 2x disk usage (temporary)
- Migration speed: > 1000 identities/second
- Query performance: No degradation

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Core Implementation
- Day 1-2: Implement geoid_to_identity patch
- Day 3-4: Add dual-write flag support
- Day 5: Update tests

### Week 2: Testing & Refinement
- Day 1-2: Integration testing
- Day 3-4: Migration script enhancement
- Day 5: Documentation update

### Week 3: Staging Deployment
- Day 1: Deploy to staging
- Day 2-4: Monitor and verify
- Day 5: Prepare production rollout

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**:
   - Set `KIMERA_ID_DUAL_WRITE=0`
   - Revert to previous code version
   - No data loss (legacy system intact)

2. **Data Recovery**:
   - Both systems have full data
   - Can rebuild from either source
   - Migration can be retried

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Alert on error rate > 1%
   - Alert on latency > 200ms
   - Alert on storage discrepancies

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Review current test failures
   - Set up development environment
   - Create feature branch for P1

2. **Development Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/p1-unified-identity
   
   # Set up test environment
   export KIMERA_ID_DUAL_WRITE=1
   pytest tests/test_p0_integration.py -v
   ```

3. **Code Review Process**:
   - PR must include tests
   - Performance benchmarks required
   - Migration guide update
   - Two approvals needed
